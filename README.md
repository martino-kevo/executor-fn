# ‚ö° Executor ‚Äì The Function Bender

> ‚ÄúIf you wield this, you are a Function Bender ‚Äî you bend functions at will. üòé‚Äù

A tiny, powerful utility for wrapping **any function** with:

- ‚ú® Immediate execution
- üß† Stateful memory
- ‚è™ Undo/redo
- ‚è∏ Pause/resume
- üß© Reactivity & history tracking

Think of it as:  
ü™Ñ **‚ÄúRedux, Zustand, and DevTools ‚Äî in one function.‚Äù**

---

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
npm install executor-fn


üí° Quick Start

import { Executor } from "executor-fn";

// Create a reactive function
const counter = Executor((n, delta) => n + delta, {
  initialArgs: [0],
  callNow: true,
  storeHistory: true,
});

counter(1); // 1
counter(5); // 6
counter.undo(); // back to 1
counter.redo(); // forward to 6

console.log(counter.value);   // 6
console.log(counter.history); // [0, 1, 6]


‚öõÔ∏è React Integration (with useExecutor)
Bind Executor directly to your UI ‚Äî no setState needed.

import React from "react";
import { Executor, useExecutor } from "executor-fn";

const store = Executor((n, d) => n + d, {
  callNow: true,
  storeHistory: true,
  initialArgs: [0],
});

export default function Counter() {
  const count = useExecutor(store); // Auto-reactive

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => store(store.value, 1)}>‚ûï</button>
      <button onClick={() => store(store.value, -1)}>‚ûñ</button>
      <button onClick={store.undo}>‚è™ Undo</button>
      <button onClick={store.redo}>‚è© Redo</button>
    </div>
  );
}
üß† No Redux. No Zustand. No boilerplate.
Just one function with memory, history, and hooks.

üß± Advanced Example ‚Äì Mini Text Editor
Use Executor to power an editor with live undo/redo:

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Executor } from "executor-fn";

const editor = Executor((_, newVal) => newVal, {
  storeHistory: true,
  callNow: true,
  initialArgs: [""],
});

export default function TextEditorApp() {
  const [text, setText] = useState(editor.value);
  const sync = () => setText(editor.value);

  return (
    <div>
      <textarea
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => {
          editor(editor.value, e.target.value);
          sync();
        }}
      />
      <button onClick={() => { editor.undo(); sync(); }}>Undo</button>
      <button onClick={() => { editor.redo(); sync(); }}>Redo</button>
      <button onClick={() => { editor.reset(); sync(); }}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

**üí° The Story Behind Executor**

I didn‚Äôt build Executor by reading tons of docs or following a course.
I was just a curious developer who wanted to understand JavaScript callbacks ‚Äî so curious that I literally prayed to God to help me understand programming better.

Then something clicked.
I wrote a small class that called a function immediately when created.
It was simple, but I shared it with ChatGPT ‚Äî and together, we refined it step by step.

ChatGPT suggested improvements, helped me add state tracking, history, reset, undo, redo, and even showed me how to make it work in React.
Suddenly I realized:

This is basically Redux + Zustand + DevTools ‚Äî but in one function.

What started as a moment of curiosity became a polished, production-ready tool that:

Calls functions immediately if you want
Remembers state and history automatically
Can undo/redo without extra libraries
Works anywhere: plain JS, React, Vue, Node, you name it
Executor is my way of saying:

"State management doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated ‚Äî and sometimes the best tools are born from curiosity, prayer, and collaboration."
